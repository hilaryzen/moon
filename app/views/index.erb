      <h3>Greetings, sister. Welcome to luna. </h3>
      <p>We are a documentation and advice resource for your period, here to help you both keep track of a current or recent cycle and navigate the pressing issues that can pop up at that time of the month. Luna is unique: our services connect you to a simple explanation of your symptoms and both conventional and different, atypical solutions that real women live by to conquer their period.</p>
  	  <p>Women are inherently lunar. We believe that periods donâ€™t have to be a blaring code-red, because with the right guidance, your cycle can be as serene as the goddess Luna. Join us in taking control of your period, and get ready to rule the moon.</p>
