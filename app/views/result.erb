    <h2>Flow</h2>
    <% flow_advice = {
      'spotty' => "If your period recently became spotty, there may be many reasons. Medication and low body weight can affect it and make it more irregular or spotty. Too little or too much progesterone, one of the hormones that your body produces, will also have the same effect. Talk to your doctor to see if this is a potential problem.", 
      'light' => "Congrats! You got lucky!", 
      'medium' => "Not bad! Your flow is a bother, but not that much!", 
      'heavy' => "Sometimes the start of a new cycle is so celebratory that it acts like a gift that just keeps on giving. And giving. And giving. Heavy to flood-warning periods can feel like a huge burden, but Luna’s got some ways for you that could help lighten the load.
      \r\nKind of like a one-size-fits-all hat, taking hormonal, birth control and getting an IUD could cover multiple period symptoms, regardless of whether they are being used for sexual activity or not. Talk to your doctor if these are good fits for you.
      \nVitamin to the Rescue: Vitamin A. According the Bustle, studies show that incorporating Vitamin A can decrease menstrual flow. If not the supplement itself, you can get your fill through carrots, sweet potato, squash, and pumpkin (think: orange veggies!).
      \nFor students, ever notice that periods in the summer are just more pleasant than any other time in the year? Maybe that’s just Luna, but reducing stress makes a huge difference in your cycle. Worry and tension can cause a buildup in the uterine lining, according to WebMD. Yoga, meditation, light exercise, and keeping in check with your mental health can make a real difference.",

    <h2>Cramps</h2>
    <% cramps_advice = {'zero' => "You're one lucky girl!", 
      'other' => "If there’s one thing Luna ain’t here for, it’s those darn cramps. They’re awful, debilitating, and the ACTUAL worse. They’re caused by prostaglandins, fatty acids and hormones that can cause cramps and other problems when they enter the bloodstream. They participate in the contractions of muscle and the inflammatory process, hence the intense cramps. But fret not, for we have some new, shiny weapons that you can add to your arsenal and hopefully defeat your cramps.\nKind of like a one-size-fits-all hat, taking hormonal, birth control and getting an IUD could cover multiple period symptoms, regardless of whether they are being used for sexual activity or not. Talk to your doctor if these are good fits for you.\nTo effectively use NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) like ibuprofen and naproxen, take them before or immediately after you get your period to block the signals of pain that activated pain receptors are sending to your brain.\nExercise. This one is pretty hit or miss, because some of us sisters need to stay in that fetal position for the whole day. But jogging, pilates, kickboxing, or just generally staying in motion can lessen the brunt of the cramps. Don’t overexert yourself on your period, but working out has been proven to increase endorphins (happy hormones!) and could really make the whole process a lot more pleasant.\nThere are a few key foods to avoid during your period. As much as you might crave an order of large fries, put a stopper on that sodium! Excess sodium can worsen cramps, as well as caffeine consumption. Try cutting out the chips and coffee and see if it lessens the agitation. Your uterus (and more!) might just thank you.\nIt’s getting hot in here! So take of all your clo– actually, keep the clothes on, but throw on some more heat. Heat relaxes and soothes your constricting muscles. A heating pad applied directly to your abdomen can make a world of a difference. You can make your own with some rice and a pillowcase or even buy ones with essential oils for further relaxation (Origins sells a great one!).\nOld Wives Tales Might Not Just Be Fiction After All: Chinese grandmas are known to be anti-cold anything, but try taking their advice and stay away from the ice cubes during your period. According to NDTV Health, “...the Health Practitioner and Macrobiotic Health Coach, Shilpa Arora [says] 'While you are on your period, you should avoid drinking cold water and eating cold foods as they worsen menstrual cramps. The muscles in the ovary and the vaginal walls tense up. These muscles cannot stretch further, which is why it leads to discomfort.’\nIf you’ve exhausted the entire list of period cramp treatments and see no signs of relief, please see your OB-GYN to make sure you don’t have a serious condition."
