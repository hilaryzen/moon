This may be because of other symptoms you have during your period, such as bloating and constipation. Luna says that sometimes she can’t even tell if she has hunger pangs or if she just has cramps! Drinking water and partaking in a non-greasy diet may help with your appetite, but if it doesn’t work, Luna suggests looking at solutions for other symptoms, since they could be the culprit!',

      'increased' => 'Don’t feel angry or insecure, this is totally normal, since your body needs a lot of extra energy during this time! Eat complex carbs and foods with a lot of essential fatty acids to stay full longer. Avoid processed sugar, salt, and fat. You can also eat smaller meals throughout the day to keep your blood sugar steady. Getting exercise and taking supplements, like a multivitamin, will also help you beat food cravings!'

During your period, the body has lower levels of serotonin, the chemical in your brain which makes you feel happy. As a result, many women crave sweets and carbs during their period. Luna says, if you’re craving them, go ahead! Have them in moderation and don’t resent yourself, because it’s totally normal.',

As a result, many women crave sweets and carbs during their period. Luna says, you can choose healthier choices like dates or cinnamon and yogurt, but go ahead and treat yourself once in a while!', 
      'salty' => 'You’re craving super salty? Find yourself wanting some potato chips or pretzels? If you’re looking for healthier options, sea salt, water-rich vegetables, and vegetables from the sea are a great choice. They contain many minerals that the body needs. Luna suggests drinking more water if you’re craving salty foods: if you’re dehydrated, the kidney needs more salt to retain fluid, and if you eat salty foods, you become dehydrated quickly! It’s a vicious cycle.',

It’s a vicious cycle.', 
      'dairy' => 'Are you itching for a milkshake, ice cream, milk, or some gorgeous melted cheese? There are many reasons why your body may crave dairy. If you’re specifically craving dairy when your period is near, rather than during the entirety of the month, it may be because you’re lacking some calcium. If you’re looking for a healthier alternative, broccoli, yogurt, and almonds are some good options. Luna says that a glass of milk never hurt anyone, though (unless you’re lactose-intolerant).', 
      'meat' => 'Sometimes you just want a big, fat, juicy steak. Or pork. I don’t know what type of meat you like. In most cases, the body craves meats such as steak which are full with iron: the body needs to replenish iron that is lost through menstruation. If you’re fatigued during your period as well, there’s a high chance that you may be anemic while on your period. This isn’t cause for concern though, since this can be fixed through diet.',
